		<h2><Font Face="Comic Sans MS" ><Font size="5" ><div style="color:#FF8888">Introduction</div></h2>
			<P><Font Face="Comic Sans MS" ><Font size="5" >South Africa, officially the Republic of South Africa (RSA), is the southernmost country in Africa.<br>South Africa is a dream destination in so many ways because of its incredible geographical diversity, its superb infrastructure, its legendary sunny weather, its super-friendly people and its affordability.<br>South Africans have been referred to as the 'rainbow nation', a title which illuminates the country's cultural diversity. The population of South Africa is one of the most complex and diverse in the world. Of the 45 million South Africans, nearly 31 million are Black, 5 million White, 3 million Coloured (a term used peoples of mixed African, Asian and White descent) and 1 million Indian. The population density is 32.9 people per sqkm.<br>
			There are 11 officially recognised languages, most of which are indigenous to South Africa.<br>
			English is spoken everywhere you go. English is the language of the cities, of commerce and banking, of government and official documents. <br>The currency of South Africa is the Rand, commonly abbreviated to R.<br>

		<p> There were many special experiences in South Africa that made my childhood fun and interesting.<br>For example, I had eaten zebra meat and I drew almost every white walls in my house, what is cool is that my parents didn't stop me from doing so, they regard this as a way of learning. Also because there is a swimming pool at the backyard, my mom started to let me swim in the pool when I was only one year old, then I took professional courses when I was three years old, so swimming became something I am really good at when I grew up.
